-getTiles() is used to generate the tiles and to display them randomly to the user. I would create the tiles by pulling the image
and by creating a class and an id holding that letter allowing it to be pulled out of the images and also made it go random by using
math and floor.
-getTotalTiles() is used to get total amount of tiles in the "bag" but did not get the chance to get it working. 
-draganddrop() was used to get the tiles individual tiles and have them be draggable to be dropped in the scoreboard picture which was the one 
line score.  I appended the tiles again after theyve been dropped to hold its class and have it's ID. I used an event to remove the tile after it was
placed down so I wouldnt have a clone of the tile sitting on the tile holder and on the board. I tried pushing it to an array to store
its value once its placed but I did not get a chance for that working correctly either. I consoled it and it indeed held the correct
ID which was its letter and element which was its index on the scrabble_board. 
-Updateboard() was used to have real time score keeping for the user but i did something wrong with the tiles and it did not work
and startted it up at 15 instead of 0. Tiles would show what tiles you put in the slot which I was very happy seeing that working.
-getKey() this was used to update the word box with the letter.
-makeStripSlots() was used to make the slots in the scoreboard which was styled with alittle CSS to make it perfect. 

Button functions didnt have any functionality yet, but wish I had time to do it. Very Fun and a deep learning experience for me with 
this project, first time doing anything with javascript, HTML, CSS, and JQuery so it was very disappointing not seeing myself finish this project.
